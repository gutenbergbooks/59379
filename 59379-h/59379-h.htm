<p class="p0"><span class="hide_me">T</span>HE successful and economical use of concrete
involves the selection of suitable materials, the
correct proportioning of mixtures in the development
of qualities to meet specific requirements, the
proper placing and the care of the green concrete.</p>

<p>A concrete of great strength is uneconomical if a
weaker mixture will serve and a cheap or weak concrete
is costly if it does not fulfill all requirements.
The cost of concrete depends not only upon the price
of the materials and labor but also upon the judicious
use of the two. Lack of foresight in locating
the mixing plant, in the design of forms, and in
planning the successive operations may cause unnecessary
expense, while neglect of any one of the
precautions which should be observed is likely to
result in unsatisfactory work.</p>

<p class="p0"><span class="hide_me">P</span>ORTLAND CEMENT concrete is the mass formed by mixing
Portland cement, sand, gravel (or particles of other suitable
materials), and water.</p>

<p>The quality of concrete may be made to conform to certain requirements
which vary with the purpose of the structure in which the
material is to be used; economy, strength, water-tightness, fire resistance,
or resistance to wear and shock may be the chief requisite.
The character of the constituent materials, the proportions in which
they are used, the consistency, the method of mixing, and the placing
and curing of the concrete are important factors in securing the
desired qualities of the finished product.</p>

<p>Total failure or a product which does not give the service expected
is often the result of the nonobservance of practices recognized as
necessary in the preparation and use of concrete. This bulletin is
intended to assist the inexperienced in making and using concrete
suitable for general farm construction and is confined to a discussion
of the rudiments of plain (not reinforced) concrete work.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="MATERIALS" id="MATERIALS">MATERIALS.</a></h2>


<h3>CEMENT.</h3>

<p>Portland cement is used because it is the only kind adapted to
general construction. Other cements are manufactured but they
possess individual characteristics that restrict their use. The word
Portland is not a trade name, but signifies the kind and distinguishes
it from the slag, natural, and other cements.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"> 2 </a></span></p>

<p>A number of brands of Portland cement are manufactured, most
of which are made to meet the requirements of a fixed standard
adopted by the United States Government and the American Society
for Testing Materials. Cement always should be tested for use in
important work, but this is impractical for the user of small amounts
and it is generally safe practice to omit the test if a reliable brand
of Portland cement of American manufacture is selected, especially
if the dealer's or manufacturer's guaranty that it meets the standard
is secured.</p>

<p>The following simple test for soundness is easily made and is on
the side of caution. Make a ball, about 1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> inches in diameter, if
neat cement and water; place it under a wet cloth and keep it moist
for 24 hours, then put the ball in a vessel of water; allow the water
to come to the boiling point slowly and to boil for 3 hours. A good
cement will not be affected, but an inferior one will check, crack,
or go to pieces entirely.</p>

<p>Portland cement is shipped in paper bags, cloth sacks, and wooden
barrels (sometimes in bulk). For the average user the cloth sack
is the best container, as it is easier to handle; and while the manufacturers
charge more for this kind of package, they allow a rebate
for the return of the sacks in good condition. A sack of Portland
cement weighs 94 pounds and a barrel contains the equivalent of
four sacks.</p>


<h3>STORING.</h3>

<p>As cement readily absorbs moisture from the atmosphere, it
should be stored in a dry place; if exposed to dampness it soon
becomes lumpy, or even a solid mass, and in this condition it is
useless and should be thrown away. The lumps caused by pressure
in piling the sacks are not injurious. They can be pulverized easily,
thus distinguishing them from those due to dampness.</p>

<p>Cement never should be stored on the ground. Build a raised
platform for it and keep it away from the sides of the shelter. As
it is heavy, care should be taken not to overload the supporting floor.</p>


<h3>FINE AGGREGATE (SAND).</h3>

<p>All grains, small pebbles, or particles of broken stone are considered
as sand if they will pass through a wire screen with one-fourth
inch meshes. The particles or grains should be hard and well
graded and should vary in size, as a stronger concrete is thus
obtained than when the size of the grains is nearly uniform. If
a large proportion of the sand is very fine an extra quantity of
cement should be used and if exceptionally fine it is advisable to use
25 per cent more cement.</p>

<p>The sand should be clean; that is, free from vegetable matter,
loam, or any considerable amount of clay. If the hands are soiled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"> 3 </a></span>
when a small quantity of sand is rubbed between them the following
test should be made: Put 4 inches of sand into a pint preserving
jar, fill with clear water to within an inch of the top, fasten
the lid, and shake the jar vigorously until the whole is thoroughly
mixed. Set the jar aside and allow the contents to settle. The sand
will settle to the bottom with the clay and loam on top of it. If
more than three-eighths of an inch of clay or loam shows, the sand
should be rejected or washed. The difference in fineness and color
shows clearly the line of division between the clay or loam and the
sand.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 414px;">
<a id="Fig_1"></a>
<img src="images/fig_1.png" width="414" height="310" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 1.</span>&mdash;Sand and gravel washing trough.</div>
</div>

<p>Should sand require washing the simplest way for small quantities
is to build a loose board platform from 10 to 15 feet long,
with one end higher than the other. On the lower end and sides
nail 2 by 6 inch boards. Spread the sand over the platform in a
layer 3 or 4 inches thick and wash with water. The water may
be supplied by any means which will cause agitation of the sand
and allow the lighter material to run off with the water. When
pressure or a head is obtainable the water is most easily applied by
means of a garden hose. The washing should be started at the
higher end and the water allowed to run through the sand and over
the 2 by 6 inch piece at the bottom. <a href="#Fig_1">Figure 1</a> illustrates a convenient
trough for washing larger quantities.</p>

<p>A small amount of clay, provided it is not in lumps, does not
injure sand, but amounts over 10 per cent should be washed out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"> 4 </a></span></p>


<h3>COARSE AGGREGATE (STONE, GRAVEL, ETC.).</h3>

<p>The larger particles used in concrete may be gravel, broken stone,
air-cooled blast-furnace slag, or other suitable materials. The coarse
aggregate should be sound and clean, that is, free from disintegrated
or soft particles, loam, clay, or vegetable matter. Air-cooled blast-furnace
slag should weigh at least 70 pounds per cubic foot. The
best results are obtained from a mixture of sizes graded from those
retained on a one-fourth inch screen to those passing a three-fourths
to 2 inch ring, depending upon the work. Ordinarily the greatest
dimension of any particle should not be over one-fourth of the thickness
of the concrete work.</p>


<h3>GRAVEL.</h3>

<p>Gravel which is too dirty for use usually can be detected by observation.
It may be washed in the same manner as sand. Lumps
of clay should be eliminated and care should be taken to see that the
gravel is not coated with a film of clay or loam which will prevent
the bonding of the cement.</p>


<h3>BROKEN STONE.</h3>

<p>Broken stone should be clean, hard, and of a size suited to the
character of the work, and the same care in grading should be
exercised as in the case of gravel. Trap, granite, hard limestone,
and hard sandstone are commonly used. The composition and
physical character of the stones should be considered, as some possess
qualities that limit their use under certain conditions (see Substitutes
for gravel).</p>

<p>Field stones are common in many localities and their use, when
crushed, may be economical. The finer particles, after the dust is
removed, can be used as sand. Small stone crushers, operated by
three or four horsepower gasoline engines, can be purchased at a
relatively low price and may prove profitable if a large quantity of
stone is needed.</p>


<h3>BANK-RUN GRAVEL.</h3>

<p>Bank or creek gravel, which will answer the purpose of sand and
gravel combined, sometimes can be obtained, and frequently it is
used in small jobs of concrete work just as it comes from the pit or
creek. Although such gravel occasionally contains nearly the right
proportions of sand and gravel, in the majority of sand pits and
gravel banks there is a great variation in the sizes of the grains and
pebbles or gravel and in the relative quantity of each. It is advisable
to screen the sand and gravel and to remix them in the correct
proportions, as well-graded aggregates make stronger concrete
and, ordinarily, enough cement will be saved to pay for the cost of
screening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"> 5 </a></span></p>

<p>Experience has shown that it is advisable to screen bank gravel
twice; first over a screen with large meshes to eliminate particles too
large for use. The size of the mesh will depend upon the nature of
the work involved (see Coarse aggregate); then the material which
has passed through this screen should be sifted again over a screen
with one-fourth inch meshes. All material which passes the latter
screen may be considered sand and should conform to the characteristics
discussed under "Fine aggregate."</p>


<h3>SUBSTITUTES FOR GRAVEL OR STONE.</h3>

<p>For general work gravel or broken stone always is preferred to
other coarse aggregate. Other materials at times are easier to obtain
and, when used with discretion, will provide a satisfactory concrete.</p>

<p>Broken terra cotta, brick, and old concrete, if hard and strong,
may be used for unimportant work where no great strength is required,
but special care should be taken that the particles do not
show on the finished surface.</p>

<p>The maxim that a chain is only as strong as its weakest link applies
to concrete. If the coarse aggregate is weaker than the cement mortar,
as in the case of some sandstones, it should be used with caution.
The aggregate may have properties that render it unsuitable for
use under certain conditions; for instance, cinders should not be
used if water-tightness or strength is expected, but they are useful for
fireproofing. Material that disintegrates or flakes when heated is
undesirable in places exposed to high temperature; thus marble and
some limestones should not be used in fireplaces. Some aggregates
when exposed at the surface of concrete are apt to cause discolorations,
and when this would be objectionable aggregates of this type
should be avoided. Flat or elongated slab-like fragments should be
avoided, as particles of this shape do not bond well; slate and shale
are examples.</p>


<h3>CINDERS.</h3>

<p>Cinders should be composed of hard, clean, vitreous clinkers, free
from sulphides, soot, and unburned coal or ashes. As a precaution
against the presence of small amounts of detrimental substances,
cinders should be soaked thoroughly with water 24 hours before
being used. If clean they will not discolor the hands when a small
quantity is rubbed between the palms.</p>

<p>Cinder concrete, on account of its light weight, commonly is used
for filling between sleepers of floors and grading roofs, and frequently
for fireproofing, for which it is very effective. Cinders
should never be used when the concrete is to be subjected to heavy
loads or abrasion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"> 6 </a></span></p>


<h3>LAVA ROCK.</h3>

<p>Lava rock varies widely in chemical composition and physical
qualities. In some instances lavas are so light and frothy or contain
so large a proportion of easily oxidizable material that they are
wholly unsuited for concrete work. In general, the lava rock found
in the Northwestern States is a suitable substitute for gravel.
Rhyolite, a light colored volcanic rock, and many of the darker
colored basaltic lavas can well be used for concrete for building
purposes.</p>


<h3>WATER.</h3>

<p>Water should be clean and free from strong acid and alkali.
Sea or brackish water should not be used if fresh water can be
obtained.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a id="PROPORTIONING_THE_MATERIALS"></a>PROPORTIONING THE MATERIALS.</h2>


<p>In mixing concrete various proportions of cement, sand, gravel,
and water are employed, depending upon the purpose for which the
concrete is to be used. The ideal mixture is one in which all the
spaces or voids between the grains of sand are filled with the cement
and all the voids in the gravel are filled with the cement-sand mortar.
This perfection is seldom attained, because the voids in each
lot of gravel and sand vary slightly, and in order to be absolutely
safe a little more sand and cement than will just fill the voids are
used.</p>

<p>The strongest concrete is not required in every structure, and, in
many instances, the cost of it would be unwarranted. For important
work involving large quantities of materials of unknown
qualities, tests should be made to determine the best proportions.
Such tests, being rather complicated, are made usually in a laboratory,
and are not practical for the user of small quantities of concrete.
Various proportions have been tested by experienced engineers to
determine which, under average conditions, will develop the greatest
strength, best resist wear, and assure greatest impermeability or
water-tightness. The mixtures given below have been found to meet
the requirements indicated, and having been adopted as arbitrary
standards, are recommended for use in farm concrete work. The
amount of water required is discussed under "Consistency."</p>


<h3>ARBITRARY MIXTURES.</h3>

<p><b>Rich mixture.</b>&mdash;Used for concrete subject to high stresses or where
exceptional water-tightness and resistance to abrasion are desired:
1:1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>:3; i. e., 1 part cement, 1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> parts sand, and 3 parts gravel.</p>

<p><b>Standard mixture.</b>&mdash;Used generally for reinforced concrete and
water-tight work: 1:2:4; i. e., 1 part cement, 2 parts sand, and 4
parts gravel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"> 7 </a></span></p>

<p><b>Medium mixture.</b>&mdash;Used for plain concrete of moderate strength:
1:3:5; i. e., 1 part cement, 3 parts sand, and 5 parts gravel.</p>

<p>Leaner mixtures are sometimes used after a test has proved them
to be suitable for the work at hand.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that always in indicating the proportions the
first number refers to the cement, the second to the sand, and the
third to the gravel. The three materials must be measured by volume,
using the same unit. The cubic foot is a convenient measure, because
a sack of cement, weighing 94 pounds, is considered to contain 1 cubic
foot.</p>

<p>When the coarse aggregate (gravel, etc.) is omitted the mixture
is generally spoken of as mortar and the proportions are indicated
thus, 1:2, meaning 1 part cement and 2 parts sand. Mortar is used
for plastering, stucco, top coats of floors, and for laying masonry.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="QUANTITIES_OF_MATERIALS_REQUIRED" id="QUANTITIES_OF_MATERIALS_REQUIRED">QUANTITIES OF MATERIALS REQUIRED.</a></h2>


<p>More concrete can be made from given volumes of aggregates if
the gravel used is graded from fine to coarse than if the particles are
too nearly of one size, because the small stones help to fill the voids
between the larger ones and less sand-cement mortar is required.
The extra mortar thus adds to the volume of the concrete.</p>

<p>A common mistake to be guarded against is to assume that the
volume of concrete produced is equal to the quantity of sand plus
the gravel as indicated in the proportion. For instance a 1:2:4
mixture will not produce 6 cubic yards of concrete, if 2 yards of
sand and 4 yards of gravel are used, because the sand will lodge
in the voids between the pebbles. If 6 cubic yards of concrete are
desired it will be necessary to use 2.7 cubic yards of sand and 5.34
cubic yards of gravel.</p>

<p>Table 1 shows the quantity of cement, sand, and gravel required
under average conditions for the indicated proportions.</p>

<h2><a name="CONSISTENCY" id="CONSISTENCY">CONSISTENCY.</a></h2>


<p>The quantity of water used in mixing has a very great influence
on the strength of the concrete. An excess of water weakens the
concrete, while an insufficient amount prevents thorough mixing.</p>

<div class="fig_left" style="width: 287px;">
<a id="Fig_2"></a>
<img src="images/fig_2.png" width="287" height="493" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 2.</span>&mdash;The result of using too dry a mixture, lack of spading
and careless placing; note irregularity of layers and
poor bonding.</div>
</div>

<p>Therefore, only sufficient
water should be
used to produce a
workable or plastic
mixture.</p>

<p>Recent tests have
proved that to secure
the greatest strength
the concrete should
be mixed considerably
drier than has
heretofore been customary.
Of course,
for thin walls containing
closely placed
reinforcement, or for
water-tightness, a
fairly wet mix is
necessary. A little
experience will show
the proper amount
of water to use.</p>

<p>A very rough estimate
of the quantity
of water required in
mixing for general
work is 4 to 5 gallons
to each sack of cement.</p>

<p>Three degrees of
consistency (corresponding
to different
proportions of
water) are used in
general practice,
namely, wet, medium, and dry. In the light of recent investigations
it is thought the wet mixture of present-day practice contains too
much water. The following definitions are therefore recommended:</p>

<p><b>Wet mixture.</b> One that does not flow readily and yet can not be
piled up. It is recommended for thin sections when reinforcement
is closely placed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"> 9 </a></span></p>

<p><b>Medium mixture.</b> One that is between the wet and dry mixture.
This consistency is recommended for general work.</p>

<p><b>Dry mixture.</b> One about like damp earth. If a handful is squeezed
it will retain its shape. This consistency requires thorough ramming
to eliminate voids and is used when forms are to be removed immediately,
but should not be used where a water-tight job is expected.
The porous structure of the concrete in <a href="#Fig_2">Figure 2</a> is due to the fact
that it was placed as a dry mixture.</p>

<h3>ESTIMATING CONCRETE.</h3>

<p>In estimating the amount of concrete in a given piece of work
and the quantities of materials required, the unit of measurement
is usually the cubic yard (27 cubic feet). The following examples
will explain best the method of determining the quantities required:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><b>Example 1.</b>&mdash;A wall 9 inches thick, 12 feet high, and 30 feet long has a door
opening 3 feet wide and 6 feet high, also a footing 18 inches wide and 9 inches
deep. The concrete is to be mixed in the proportions of 1:2:4.</p>

<p>The volume of the footing is found by multiplying together the dimensions
expressed in feet, thus, 1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> &times;<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> &times; 30 = 33<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cubic feet. Similarly, the volume in
the wall is<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> &times; 12 &times; 30, less the door opening<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> &times; 3 &times; 6 = 256<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> cubic feet.</p>

<p>The total volume in footing and wall is 290<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cubic feet = 10<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cubic yards.</p>

<p>To find the quantity of cement, sand, and gravel, multiply the amounts for
1 cubic yard, indicated in line 7 of Table 1, by 10<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub>, and it will be found that
65 sacks of cement, 4.83 cubic yards of sand, and 9.56 cubic yards of gravel
are necessary to build the wall.</p>

<p><b>Example 2.</b>&mdash;A pavement 27 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 6 inches thick has a
5-inch base mixed in the proportions of 1:3:5 and a 1-inch surface mixed in
the proportions of 1:2.</p>

<p>The volume in the base is 27 &times; 4 &times;<sup>5</sup>/<sub>12</sub> = 45 cubic feet = 1<sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub> cubic yards.</p>

<p>The volume in the top is 27 &times; 4 &times;<sup>1</sup>/<sub>12</sub> = 9 cubic feet =<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> cubic yard.</p>

<p>Multiplying the quantities in line 9 of Table 1 by 1<sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub> and those in line 2
by it is found that the base requires 7.74 sacks cement; 0.86 cubic yard
sand; 1.43 cubic yards gravel; and the top requires 4.49 sacks cement; 0.33
cubic yard sand.</p>

<p><b>Example 3.</b><a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>&mdash;A tank 9 feet inside diameter has walls 6 inches thick and 4 feet
high (above the floor). The floor is 6 inches thick, the concrete is to be 1:2:4.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> A practical rule in finding the area of a circle is to multiply one-half the diameter
(radius) by itself and the product by<sup>22</sup>/<sub>7</sub>. In finding the volume in the wall of a circular
structure, such as a silo or tank, the area of the circle formed by the inside circumference
is deducted from the area of the circle formed by the outside circumference and
the remainder is multiplied by the height.</p></div>

<p>The volume in the floor is<sup>10</sup>/<sub>2</sub> &times;<sup>10</sup>/<sub>2</sub> &times;<sup>22</sup>/<sub>7</sub> &times;<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> = 39<sup>2</sup>/<sub>7</sub> Cubic feet.</p>

<p>The area of the larger circle is 5 &times; 5 &times;<sup>22</sup>/<sub>7</sub> = 78<sup>4</sup>/<sub>7</sub> cubic feet.</p>

<p>The area of the smaller circle is 4<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> &times; 4<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> &times;<sup>22</sup>/<sub>7</sub> = 63<sup>4</sup>/<sub>7</sub> cubic feet.</p>

<p>The area of the wall, therefore, is 15 cubic feet and the volume is 15 &times; 4 = 60
cubic feet.</p>

<p>The total volume in the structure is 99<sup>2</sup>/<sub>7</sub> cubic feet or 3<sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub> cubic yards.
Multiplying the quantities in line 7 of Table 1 by 3<sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub>, it is found that the
following material is needed: 22.14 sacks of cement; 1.65 cubic yards of sand;
3.27 cubic yards of gravel.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"> 10 </a></span></p>


<h2><a id="FORMS"></a>FORMS.</h2>


<p>Forms are required to hold the concrete in place until it has attained
sufficient strength to sustain itself and the initial loads to
which it may be subjected. Concrete is plastic and will assume the
shape of the form, thus any imperfection or impression on the
face of the forms will be reproduced.</p>

<p>Wood is commonly used for forms, as it can be easily worked into
different shapes, though various other materials sometimes are better
adapted to special conditions. Cast iron, for instance, is suitable
for casting small objects that are to be reproduced in quantities, such
as concrete block or tile; plaster of Paris, glue, or moist sand are
employed for casting ornaments or to produce a fine, smooth surface;
sheet metal is suitable when the forms can be used repeatedly or for
such circular structures as silos. When the sides of an excavation
are not likely to cave in the earth may serve as a form.</p>


<h3>WOOD FORMS.</h3>

<p>Wood for forms must be of a kind that is easily worked and that
will retain its shape when exposed to the weather. White pine is
the best wood, but is seldom used because of its cost. Spruce, yellow
pine, and fir are satisfactory woods for forms and are best, used partially
green or unseasoned.</p>

<p>The edges of boards should be surfaced, tongued and, grooved, or
beveled in order to obtain a tight form, so that the soft mortar will
not ooze out. A better surface* is secured if the boards are dressed
on one side and are free of loose knots or other imperfections.</p>

<p>As forms must be removed, they should be so planned that they
can be taken down without destroying the lumber, especially if the
boards are used for sheathing or again for forms. Therefore the
nailing of the boards to the support should be only sufficient to keep
them in place until the concrete has hardened. Greasing the surface
next to the concrete with crude oil, soap solution, or linseed oil will
prevent the concrete from adhering and facilitate removal.</p>


<h3>METAL FORMS.</h3>

<p>Metal forms can be used to advantage when the work involved is
to be repeated many times. If it is known or if it is probable that
the forms may have to be altered, the relative costs of wood and metal
forms should be carefully determined.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"> 11 </a></span></p>

<p>Metal forms of various types and designs may be purchased. Although
the first cost may be high, yet their use may lower the total
cost when the work is such as to warrant it.</p>

<p>Circular forms may be built as shown in <a href="#Fig_3">Figure 3</a>. The sheathing
is generally of wood 4 to 6 inches wide, or sheet metal, and, if of
wood, is laid perpendicular to the battens. In forms of small diameter,
sheet metal sheathing is
necessary if a smooth surface
is desired, as the 4-inch boards
can not be made to conform to
a true circle. The radius used
for cutting the battens of
the inner circle should be the
thickness of the sheathing less
than the inside radius of the
structure and the same amount
greater than the outer radius
for the outside battens.</p>


<div class="fig_left" style="width: 234px;">
<a id="Fig_3"></a>
<img src="images/fig_3.png" width="234" height="472" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 3.</span>&mdash;Suggestion for circular form.</div>
</div>

<h3>REMOVAL OF FORMS.</h3>

<p>The period of time after
which forms may be removed
varies according to conditions.
Rich and dry mixtures set
quickly, and warm weather
tends to hasten the setting of
concrete. The character of the
structural member and the
loadings also must be considered.</p>

<p>Thus, an unloaded wall 12
inches or more thick may be
stripped of forms in from 1 to
3 days, while the forms of
thinner walls should remain in
place from 2 to 5 days. Slab
forms and the sides of beam
and girder forms may be removed in from 6 to 14 days if the span
is not over 7 feet. The bottoms of beam and girder forms, even
though of a span less than 7 feet, should remain in place and braced
form 10 to 14 days and even longer. Experience is the best guide to
the time of removal, but if there is any doubt ample time should be
allowed, especially in cold weather.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"> 12 </a></span></p>


<h3>BUILDING AND SETTING FORMS.</h3>

<p>Concrete, while plastic, exerts a great pressure on the confining
walls, necessitating rigid tying and bracing of the forms to keep
them from bulging out of alignment. The effect of the bulging of
a form is corrected only at a considerable expense; hence it is advisable
to pour the concrete to a depth of not more than 2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> or 3
feet, allowing it to set or harden before pouring more.</p>

<p>The form most used in concrete construction is that for a straight
wall. The methods of building such a form apply in general to
the forms for most structural work, though modifications may be
necessary to meet particular conditions.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 420px;">
<a id="Fig_4"></a>
<img src="images/fig_4.png" width="420" height="327" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 4.</span>&mdash;Form for basement or cellar wall. The earth may be used as an outside form
if it is sufficiently firm.</div>
</div>

<p>The straight wall form may be built continuous (Figs. <a href="#Fig_4">4</a> and <a href="#Fig_5">5</a>),
or in panels of a size convenient to handle, and from stock lengths
of lumber (<a href="#Fig_6">Fig. 6</a>). Generally the face boards are placed horizontally
and secured to studs or posts. The face boards may be 1 or 2
inches thick and from 6 to 10 inches wide, preference being given
to the narrower widths, which are less liable to cup or warp. The
thickness depends upon the spacing of the studs, the number of
times the forms are to be used, and the depth of pouring. Ordinary
sheathing, if the joints are made tight, is satisfactory for
foundations of dwellings, etc., and the studs, if 2 by 4 inches, should
be spaced 18 inches on centers. The studs for a long, high form
had best be 4 by 4 inches or 2 by 6 inches, spaced from 2 to 3 feet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"> 13 </a></span>
center to center. The studs of the inside and outside forms must be
tied together to prevent spreading; this is conveniently done with No.
10 wire, as shown in <a href="#Fig_4">Figure 4</a>, or with one-half or three-quarter inch
bolts, which is the more expensive method. Bolts should be greased
to facilitate removal. Temporary spacers of wood, 1 by 2 inches,
of a length equal to the thickness of the wall, should be used to prevent
drawing the forms together when the wire or bolt is tightened.
They should be spaced at the ties, but need not be at every
wire, and are knocked out and removed as the concreting progresses.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 427px;">
<a id="Fig_5"></a>
<img src="images/fig_5.png" width="427" height="306" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 5.</span>&mdash;Straight wall form for level ground.</div>
</div>

<p>The ties should be spaced on each stud about 2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> feet vertically. If
more than 3 feet of concrete is poured at one time the ties should be
closer together, vertically, at the bottom of each pouring. The
thickness of the wall does not affect the number of ties. On removing
the forms the wires should be clipped close to the face of the
concrete and punched back, unless the surface is to be stuccoed. If
a pit hole is caused by punching back the wire it should be pointed
up with mortar, which then should be rubbed to make it blend with
the general surface.</p>

<h2><a name="MIXING" id="MIXING">MIXING.</a></h2>


<h3>PREPARATION OF PLANT.</h3>

<p>Before starting to mix, annoyance and money may be saved by
planning the location of the mixing plant with regard to convenience
in depositing the concrete in the forms and ease of access
to the materials. Often the board can be located so that by moving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"> 14 </a></span>
it once or twice the bulk of the concrete may be shoveled directly
into the forms. It is more economical to wheel material a distance of
from 10 to 25 feet than to carry it in shovels. Eight feet is about as
far as it is profitable to shovel.</p>

<p>When material is to be wheeled, runways of planks should be provided,
because more material can be handled in a given time, and the
wear and tear on men and equipment is not so great. The planks
used in the runways should be thick enough to sustain the weight
passing over them and should be 10 to 12 inches wide to permit foot
room. They should be anchored securely and made rigid, as springy
or loose boards retard progress of the work. Smooth joints in the
planking will prevent bumping and stumbling.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 431px;">
<a id="Fig_6"></a>
<img src="images/fig_6.png" width="431" height="365" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 6.</span>&mdash;Sectional forms.</div>
</div>


<h3>NUMBER OF MEN.</h3>

<p>The number of men required is determined by the amount of concrete
to be placed in a given time, the method of mixing, and the
size of the batch; that is, the number of bags of cement mixed at
one time. The amount of concrete one man can mix by hand in a
day depends upon the experience of the man, the layout of the work,
and other duties required of him. One man should average 1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> to 1<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub>
cubic yards of concrete in eight hours, including mixing and wheeling
not more than 50 feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"> 15 </a></span></p>

<p>The gang for a one-bag batch may consist of 3 men, but a larger
number make a more efficient force, for when the concrete is mixed
by hand the men can take turns at the various tasks and will not
tire so easily. The assigning of tasks so that each man's time fits
into that of the others requires considerable study and is one of
the chief factors making for loss or profit.</p>


<h3>MACHINE MIXING.</h3>

<p>Good concrete can be mixed by hand or machine. The quantity
of concrete work in prospect is the factor that determines the more
economical method. A small amount (say 100 to 200 cubic yards)
does not warrant the purchase of a machine, but it is often feasible
and economical to hire a machine from a neighbor or contractor
if the quantity of concrete to be placed is more than 15 cubic yards.</p>

<p>A mixer should be purchased only after careful consideration of
the amount and character of the work to be done and the conditions
affecting its use.</p>

<p>The two types of mixers most used are the batch mixer, which
mixes and dumps a definite quantity, and the continuous, which
discharges a constant stream of concrete. The continuous type
is not adapted to farm work unless the concrete can be handled as
fast as it is mixed, thus permitting the machine to work continuously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"> 16 </a></span></p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 421px;">
<a id="Fig_7"></a>
<img src="images/fig_7.png" width="421" height="306" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 7.</span>&mdash;Home made concrete mixer.</div>
</div>

<p>There are numerous types and various sizes of batch mixers. A
one-bag batch machine is most suitable for general work, though
there are smaller mixers that may prove handy. Some of the
smallest sizes are operated by hand, but the medium and large sizes
are power operated. Mixers can be had with or without the power
plant attached and may be stationary or on wheels, which facilitate
moving to different sites. Engines used for sawing wood, the larger
ones used for pumping water, and tractors furnish sufficient power
to operate an average mixer. <a href="#Fig_7">Figure 7</a> shows a homemade mixer
built of discarded farm implement parts and operated by the farm
engine.</p>

<p>Directions for operating a mixer are generally furnished with the
machine. The tendency is to use too much water in mixing concrete
in a machine. The consistency of the mixture should be as described
under the heading "Consistency" on page 8. The mixing should
be continued for at least a minute after the drum has been charged,
but a better mixture is secured if two minutes are allowed. At the
end of each day's work the machine should be thoroughly washed,
and when not in use it should be well greased and covered.</p>


<h3>HAND MIXING.</h3>


<p>Hand mixing is the more economical on the farm unless a large
amount of work is to be done at one time. Few tools need be purchased,
and, as a rule, only farm help need be employed. The following
tools will be needed in mixing and placing plain concrete:
Two or more square-end short-handled shovels, 1 heavy garden rake,
1 sprinkling can or bucket (if a hose is not available), 1 52-gallon
barrel, 2 wheelbarrows with metal trays, 1 sand screen (<a href="#Fig_8">Fig. 8</a>), 1
tamper (<a href="#Fig_9">Fig. 9</a>), 1 wood float or trowel (<a href="#Fig_10">Fig. 10</a>), measuring boxes
(<a href="#Fig_11">Fig. 11</a>), mixing board (<a href="#Fig_12">Fig. 12</a>), 1 spader (<a href="#Fig_13">Fig. 13</a>). The number
of shovels and wheelbarrows needed will depend upon the size
of the batch, number of men mixing, and the layout of the work.
Long-handled pointed shovels will be found more convenient at the
sand and gravel piles.</p>

<p>A bottomless box is necessary for convenient and accurate measurement
of the sand and gravel. Where wheelbarrow measurement of
materials is practiced, as in charging a mixer, the capacity of the
wheelbarrow should be determined by use of a measuring box. The
box may be made as illustrated in <a href="#Fig_11">Figure 11</a>, from boards 12 inches
wide. The dimensions in Table 2 are of boxes for use in measuring
quantities for mixtures of various proportions, assuming that one
bag of cement is used in a batch. If two bags are used in a batch
the boxes should be filled twice.</p>

<p>A tight platform should be provided similar to that illustrated
in <a href="#Fig_12">Figure 12</a> upon which to mix the concrete. For mixing 1 or 2
bag batches a platform 9 by 10 feet will serve.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"> 18 </a></span></p>


<h3>DIRECTIONS FOR HAND MIXING.</h3>

<p>The mixing board should be located in convenient relation to
the supply of materials and the work and should be level. The sand
box is placed on the board, about 2 feet from one of the longer
sides, and filled level with sand; the box is then lifted away and
the sand spread in a 3 or 4 inch layer. The cement is spread as
evenly as possible on' top of the sand. Two men with shovels,
standing on opposite sides of the pile, turn the sand and cement in
such a way that the materials axe thoroughly mixed. In turning
the material it should not be simply dumped off the shovel, but
should be shaken off the ends and sides, so that the two constituents
will be mixed as they fall. The mass should be turned two or
three times, or until it is of uniform color and there are no streaks
of either sand or cement. A man with a hoe or rake may assist by
raking the top over as the two men turn. When the sand-cement
mixture is of a uniform color it should be spread out carefully in
a layer and the gravel box placed on top. The box is filled with
gravel and then removed, the gravel being spread over the sand-cement
mixture. The mass is soaked with about one-half the quantity
of water to be used, care being taken not to wash away any
of the cement. The materials then should be turned over in much
the same manner as was the sand-cement, except that instead of
shaking them off the end of the shovel the whole load should be
dumped and dragged back toward the mixer with the square end
of the shovel. The wet gravel picks up the sand and cement as it
rolls over when dragged back. The mixing should be continued
until the mass is uniform, water being added to the dry spots
during the mixing until the desired consistency is obtained.</p>

<p>Experience counts considerably in mixing concrete with the least
amount of labor; ordinarily three or four turnings are required to
mix the materials thoroughly. After the final turning the concrete
should be shoveled into a compact pile and then is ready for placing
in the forms.</p>

<h2><a name="PLACING" id="PLACING">PLACING.</a></h2>


<h3>PLACING CONCRETE.</h3>

<p>The mixed concrete should be deposited in the forms within from
20 to 30 minutes from the time the water is added to the cement,
as it begins to set or harden after this time. To disturb the concrete
after the set has begun is risky, as it will lose some of its strength,
the extent of the injury depending upon the seriousness of the
disturbance.</p>

<p>Concrete which has set before it can be placed in the forms should
not be tempered or softened with water, but should be discarded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"> 19 </a></span></p>

<p>To prevent delay in placing, all forms should be examined before
the mixing is begun to see that they are properly braced, that all
chips or loose particles are removed, that the surface of concrete
which has set has been properly roughened and wetted to assure a
bond, as described on page 20, and that all reinforcement, bolts,
inserts, etc., are properly located and secured.</p>

<p>At the lunch' period, or at the end of a day's work, the mixing
board and equipment should be thoroughly washed, for if this is
not done many pounds of heavy concrete are needlessly carried
around by the men and the addition of a pound in the weight of
tools will lower the efficiency of the workers. Moreover, it will save
time and wear and tear of equipment incident to cutting the surplus
concrete away with a cold chisel.</p>

</div>

<p>In depositing concrete in the forms care should be taken that the
materials do not separate.</p>

<p>If the mixing is done close to the place of depositing, the concrete
may be shoveled into the forms directly or through a chute. If it is
necessary to lift or transport the concrete, buckets and wheelbarrows
are convenient containers. The concrete should be deposited
in horizontal layers, preferably not over 6 inches thick, and a spade
or paddle should be worked up and down against the forms to push
the coarse material away from the surface, as illustrated in <a href="#Fig_13">Figure
13</a>. The object of the spading is to eliminate impounded air that
may form pockets in the mass and to insure a smoother and more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"> 20 </a></span>
impervious surface. In addition to being spaded, stiff concrete
should be rammed until water flushes to the surface. Tapping the
forms with a hammer is a very effective way of securing a smooth
surface. <a href="#Fig_14">Figure 14</a> shows the result of improper spading.</p>

</div>

<p>Fresh concrete will riot bond readily to concrete that has hardened
and a seam may be formed that will permit water to trickle through.
When bonding fresh concrete to that which has been in place for a
short time it is usually sufficient to roughen the hardened surface
with a pick or by other means so as to expose the gravel or stone,
and to clean off all loose particles. The hardened
concrete should be soaked with water, the excess
water removed, and the surface then given a coat
of grout (a mixture of cement and water) of the
consistency of cream just before the new concrete
is deposited.</p>

<p>When pouring of a wall is to be discontinued for
some time, provision for the bonding of future
work should be made. This may be done by placing
short steel dowels in the concrete when it is
poured, or a rebated joint or groove may be made, as shown in <a href="#Fig_15">Figure
15</a>. In bonding a new wall to old concrete, holes should be drilled for
the dowels, which should be grouted in, and the old surface should
be roughened, cleaned, and wetted; or a groove may be cut in the old
wall to receive the new concrete.</p>

<h3>PLACING UNDER WATER.</h3>

<p>Concrete can be placed under still water if proper precautions are
taken. It should never be placed, while soft, in running water unless
a form or cofferdam is used, as the cement will be washed out. When
concrete is to be placed under water a form of tube or chute, known
as a tremie (<a href="#Fig_16">Fig. 16</a>), may be used advantageously. The tube should
be of sheet metal, about 8 inches in diameter, with a hopper on top,
and means should be provided for quickly raising and lowering it
without jolts, so that the concrete will feed out at the bottom without
breaking the seal. The lower end of the tube should rest on the
bottom or on the concrete as it is built up and a continuous flow of
concrete, mixed somewhat soft so that it will flow easily, should be
maintained.</p>

<p>Scum or laitance is likely to form on concrete when placed under
water, and unless all of the concrete is! poured in one operation and
brought to a little above the water surface, seams or planes of
weakness will occur.</p>

<h2><a name="CARE_OF_CONCRETE" id="CARE_OF_CONCRETE">CARE OF CONCRETE.</a></h2>


<p>After the concrete has been poured, care should be taken that it
does not dry out too quickly, and in hot weather it must be protected
from the sun. Exposed surfaces
and objects made of dry concrete
should be sprayed thoroughly with
water twice or oftener each day
for a week or 10 days. Sometimes
surfaces are shielded with canvas,
paper, boards, or layers of moist
sand.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="PROTECTION_FROM_FREEZING_WEATHER" id="PROTECTION_FROM_FREEZING_WEATHER">PROTECTION FROM FREEZING WEATHER.</a></h2>


<h3>CONCRETING IN FREEZING WEATHER.</h3>

<p>If suitable methods are used,
good concrete work can be done in
cold weather, but with more difficulty
and at somewhat greater cost
than when the weather is warm.
Ordinarily it is best not to attempt
to do concrete work during freezing
weather. However, the extra
cost at times may be warranted by
urgent need of the structure or the
fact that other farm work is not
so pressing during the winter and
the concrete work may be carried
on without seriously interfering
with regular farm operations.</p>

<p>Concrete must be protected from
alternate freezing and thawing
until it has set. Cold retards the
setting and hardening of concrete;
therefore, even though the temperature
is not at the freezing
point, the concrete should be protected and special care taken not to
subject it to loads. The forms should be kept in place until there is
no doubt that the concrete has properly hardened. Hot water
should be poured on the concrete to make sure that apparent hardness
is real and not due to a frozen condition. Just before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"> 22 </a></span>
the concrete is placed all ice and frost should be removed from
the forms and reinforcement, if used, by warming the surfaces with
steam or by other means.</p>

<p>Concrete that has been frozen once may, with proper care, attain
its ultimate strength, but should it freeze a second time the chances
of saving the work are very slight. Exposed surfaces are apt to
scale or pit if the concrete is allowed to freeze before it is thoroughly
hardened.</p>

<p>Pleating the materials, protecting the green concrete, and the use
of salt are precautions generally taken to prevent freezing.</p>


<h3>THE USE OF SALT.</h3>

<p>The use of salt is objectionable, as it forms a white efflorescence
on exterior surfaces and is liable to corrode the steel in reinforced
concrete work. The quantity of salt required varies with the temperature,
but it should not exceed 10 per cent of the weight of the
water used in mixing. A 10 per cent solution is eight-tenths (approximately
13 ounces) of a pound of salt per gallon of water and
will prevent freezing at a temperature of 22&deg; F. Lower temperatures
would require a greater proportion of salt, which would impair
the strength of the concrete, and hence is not practicable.</p>

<p>A rule, frequently advocated, for varying the percentage of salt
is to use 1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> ounces per gallon of water for each degree Fahrenheit
below freezing. Since it is impossible to foretell the exact drop in
temperature, the exact quantity of salt can not be predetermined,
so that provision should be made for several degrees lower than anticipated.
The salt should be dissolved in the mixing water, and in
order that the proportion be correct the amount of water required
for each batch should be determined by trial and this quantity used
throughout the work.</p>


<h3>THE USE OF HEAT.</h3>

<p>Perhaps the most satisfactory method of preventing freezing of
concrete is to heat the materials and to inclose or cover the completed
work for a few days or until most of the water has disappeared and
sufficient strength has developed. In extreme weather protection
may be needed for five or six days. When the weather is cold but not
freezing, heating the materials will be sufficient. If a freeze is expected
the concrete work should be protected by wood inclosures,
paper, or canvas, over which, if the surface is horizontal, may be
spread a 6 or 8 inch layer of straw. Manure should not be used to
protect fresh concrete, since the acids in it are destructive and cause
unsightly stains. Splits or other openings in coverings may admit
cold, which may freeze parts of the work. As the temperature drops
(to about 20&deg; F.) it will be necessary to arrange the covering so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"> 23 </a></span>
that live steam can be turned in between it and the concrete or that
heat may be supplied from stoves or salamanders.</p>

<p>Mass work, except in very cold weather, will not require as careful
protection as thin sections and, as a rule, the forms are sufficient if
the exposed parts are covered.</p>


<h3>HEATING MATERIALS.</h3>

<p>The water can be heated sufficiently for use in concrete (approximately
150&deg; F.) in kettles on stoves or by steam from a boiler.</p>

<p>A metal smokestack placed horizontally with a fire in one end
makes an efficient heater for the sand and gravel. The materials are
piled over the stack, but not so high that their weight will crush the
pipe. Small quantities of sand and gravel may be heated on top of
metal plate with a fire under it. If a small boiler is available it
may be economical to use steam for heating the sand and gravel.
Steam is effective when forced from nozzles into the piles or circulated
through perforated pipes placed under the material. Covering
the piles with canvas or other material will retain much of the heat.</p>

</div>


<p>Concrete expands and contracts with changes in temperature,
causing cracks to appear. Contraction cracks occur in thin sections
exposed to wide variations in temperature and are
common in sidewalks; therefore, large stretches of
concrete should not be laid without breaks or
spaces to allow for the changes in size. The spaces
should be filled with tar or some similar material
that will yield or give when the concrete expands.
A joint like that shown in <a href="#Fig_17">Figure 17</a> is frequently
used for thick walls. A section of the wall is
poured and before the next is poured the abutting
end is covered with tar and paper, the thickness
of the covering depending upon the length of the
section and the exposure. Sidewalks and similar work, when not cast
in alternate blocks, should have a one-fourth inch space left at intervals
of 40 feet. The joint may be filled with tar paper or tar. Steel
is used to take care of contraction in long or high walls and water-tight
work. Important structures in which temperature reinforcement
is necessary should be designed by one experienced in concrete
design.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="LINTELS" id="LINTELS">LINTELS.</a></h2>


<p>The subject of reinforced concrete is not within the province of
this bulletin, but as openings of various widths are required in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"> 24 </a></span>
walls of most farm structures, a general explanation is given of the
reinforcement of lintels or that portion of concrete immediately
above an opening, such as a floor or window.</p>

<p>A lintel is a beam, and when a beam bends the lower part is
stretched or pulled while the upper portion is compressed. Good
concrete will stand great pressure but is not capable of resisting
any great pulling or tensile stress. For this reason steel is used in
the lower portion to take care of the tensile or pulling force.</p>

<p>It will be found generally satisfactory, where no heavy or concentrated
load occurs over an opening and the span is not more than
4 feet, to place two rods three-eighths of an inch in diameter in the
bottom of the lintel, so that there will be 1 inch of concrete below
them. Two diagonal rods should be placed at each top corner of a
window or door, as shown in <a href="#Fig_18">Figure 18</a>. When the opening is between
4 and 8 feet the rods should be bent up as shown in <a href="#Fig_19">Figure 19</a>
and when between 8 and 12 feet, three one-half inch rods should be
used, two of them being bent.</p>

<p>Barbed wire, old fencing, and scrap or rusty iron is not suitable
for reinforcement. Loose rust should be cleaned off the rods and
they should be free of grease and oil.</p>

<h2><a name="SURFACE_FINISH" id="SURFACE_FINISH">SURFACE FINISH.</a></h2>


<p>Joints and imperfections in the forms are reproduced on the concrete
surfaces. Patches of honeycomb and rough places are left
where the mortar has run out of the forms or where the concrete
has not been properly placed. Such imperfections do not necessarily
affect the strength of the concrete, but they do detract from the appearance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"> 25 </a></span>
(see <a href="#Fig_14">Fig. 14</a>). Too of ten the finishing of the concrete work in even
the more important farm buildings is neglected. With little extra
trouble exposed surfaces can be given a finish which will add to the
attractiveness and hence the value of the completed work. Rubbing
off the form marks and pointing up depressions or holes greatly
improves the appearance of the work. The rubbing may be done
with a wooden float or hard-burned brick, using a little sand and
water as an abrasive and a 1:2 mortar for pointing up. The surface
can be worked best if the forms are removed within 24 hours
or before the concrete has set too hard. After the concrete has
hardened it may be necessary to use a carborundum block for rubbing.</p>

<p>A pleasing finish can be secured by scrubbing the surface with a
stiff fiber or wire brush, using plenty of water to wash off the
loosened particles. The work must be done while the surface is
workable for if the concrete is too green or soft the aggregate will
break out and if too hard the work can not be done effectively.</p>

<p>Artistic effects can be secured by picking or tooling the surface
with a bush hammer, toothed chisel, or pick. For such treatment
the concrete should be two or three weeks old to prevent breaking
out the aggregate. Other finishes may be obtained by etching with
acid to expose selected colored aggregates and by the application
of stucco. The limitations of the bulletin do not permit of a discussion
of these more elaborate treatments.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CONCRETE_EXPOSED_TO_FIRE" id="CONCRETE_EXPOSED_TO_FIRE">CONCRETE EXPOSED TO FIRE.</a></h2>


<p>Concrete is practically fireproof in that it can not be consumed
by fire, but unless properly made and of the right materials it will
disintegrate, at least on the surface.</p>

<p>To resist fire concrete should be mixed fairly rich, say, 1:1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>:3,
or 1:2:4 and special care should be taken to grade the sand and
gravel to secure a dense mixture.</p>

<p>The aggregates should be selected with a view to their fire-resisting
properties. The sand should be siliceous and the larger
aggregate should not disintegrate when heated; hence, marble,
granite, limestone, materials containing quartz, and some gravels
are unsuitable. Cinders are specially valuable, due to their non-conductivity,
but can not be used where strength is required. Trap
rock will resist destruction by heat and produce a strong concrete.
Blast furnace slag is very good for this purpose.</p>

<p>Fireplaces and chimneys of dwellings<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> may be constructed of
ordinary concrete but the back, jambs, and inner hearth, which
are directly exposed to the heat of the fire, should be made of
specially prepared concrete as described above or should be lined
with firebrick, although concrete made with broken hard-burned
brick or terra cotta has been used successfully. If suitable large-sized
aggregate is not available a mixture of one part cement and
three parts sand may be used.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<h2><a name="WATER-TIGHT_CONCRETE" id="WATER-TIGHT_CONCRETE">WATER-TIGHT CONCRETE.</a></h2>

<p>Practical water-tightness in concrete may be secured by using a
fairly rich mixture properly proportioned. Foreign ingredients,
membrane and surface coatings, or other means need not be used,
except where poor workmanship is likely or where considerable
damage and inconvenience may result in case of leakage. Under
such circumstances the membrane treatment used in addition to a
properly proportioned concrete, while the most expensive method
of waterproofing, probably will give the most reliable results. This
treatment consists of layers of burlap or tar paper cemented to the
surface and together with tar or asphalt. Where the membrane is
subject to injury it is sometimes protected by a coating of cement
mortar or brick backing.</p>

<p>First-class workmanship and special attention to details are
required to secure water-tightness. The essential requisite is that
the voids be filled. A lean mixture may be made more impervious
by using hydrated lime which tends to fill the voids and makes
the concrete flow easily. A little more cement in the mixture would
serve the same purpose. The lime should not be in excess of 10
per cent of the weight of the cement and under no circumstances
should unslaked lime be used.</p>

<p>The materials for water-tight concrete must be well graded,
so as to obtain a maximum density; that is, enough sand must be
used to fill the spaces between the gravel or stone and enough cement
to fill the spaces between the grains of sand. A 1:2:4 concrete
will prove practically impermeable in ordinary construction, but
if a head or pressure of water is to be resisted a 1:2:3 or richer
mixture may be necessary. The consistency is very important. A
sluggishly flowing consistency is best, for if the concrete is too
wet the mortar may flow away from the stone, leaving leaky places
and, if too dry, the mass may prove porous. The proportions and
consistency must be accurately maintained for each batch and the
concrete must be exceptionally well mixed.</p>

<p>It is necessary to exercise great care in the placing of the concrete.
Where practicable, the structure or object should be poured
in one operation to avoid leaky joints, but when this is not possible
precautions should be taken to secure a tight joint between concrete
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"> 27 </a></span>
of different ages. The surface of concrete which has set must be
cleaned of dirt and scum down to the true concrete. This surface
then should be well whetted and painted immediately with a creamy
mixture of cement and water before placing the new concrete. A
good plan, when discontinuing work on structures intended to hold
liquids, is to embed a 6 or 8 inch strip of tin or thin sheet metal to
half its width in the concrete so that the other half will project into
the new concrete.</p>

<p>A wall thick enough to resist the stresses put upon it will generally
resist percolation of water, but 6 inches may be considered as a
minimum.</p>

<p>Contraction and expansion must be controlled to avoid the occurrence
of leaks. To guard against cracks due to unequal settlement
or other causes, most concrete designed for water-tightness should be
reinforced. In some mass work, special contraction joints, as
described on page 23 may be necessary. Rules for the use of reinforcement
and contraction joints can not be given, as the requirements
in each case vary with the conditions to be met.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
